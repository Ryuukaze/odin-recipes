    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound (450g) lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 pound (450g) ground beef (or a mixture of beef and pork)</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 can (28 ounces) crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 cups ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>Fresh basil leaves for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet or saucepan, cook the ground beef over medium heat until browned. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, and sauté until the onion is soft and translucent.</li>
        <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, dried oregano, dried basil, salt, and pepper. Simmer the sauce for about 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it thickens slightly. Adjust the seasoning to taste.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, mix together the ricotta cheese and grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>To assemble the lasagna, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange a layer of lasagna noodles on top of the sauce, slightly overlapping them.</li>
        <li>Spread half of the ricotta mixture evenly over the noodles, then sprinkle about a third of the shredded mozzarella cheese on top.</li>
        <li>Repeat the layers: sauce, noodles, remaining ricotta mixture, another third of the mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Finish with a final layer of noodles, the remaining sauce, and the rest of the mozzarella cheese on top.</li>
        <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil, tenting it slightly so it doesn't touch the cheese. This helps to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>Bake the lasagna in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Then, remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes or until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown.</li>
        <li>Let the lasagna rest for about 10 minutes before slicing and serving. Garnish with fresh basil leaves if desired.</li>
    </ol>
