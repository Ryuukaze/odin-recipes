    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <h3>Ingredients for the crust:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups (150g) graham cracker crumbs (or cookie crumbs like digestive biscuits)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup (50g) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (113g) unsalted butter, melted</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Ingredients for the filling:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 packages (8 ounces each) cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups (250g) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (120ml) sour cream</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (120ml) heavy cream</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 325°F (160°C). Grease a 9-inch (23cm) springform pan with butter or non-stick cooking spray.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, mix together the graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and melted butter until well combined and the mixture resembles wet sand.</li>
        <li>Press the crumb mixture firmly into the bottom of the prepared springform pan, using the back of a spoon or your fingertips to create an even layer. Bake the crust in the preheated oven for 10 minutes, then remove and set aside to cool.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened cream cheese and sugar together using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed.</li>
        <li>Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add the vanilla extract and mix until incorporated.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the sour cream, heavy cream, and flour until smooth. Gradually add this mixture to the cream cheese mixture, beating on low speed until combined and smooth.</li>
        <li>Pour the cheesecake filling over the cooled crust in the springform pan. Smooth the top with a spatula to create an even layer.</li>
        <li>Place the springform pan on a baking sheet to catch any potential leaks during baking. Bake the cheesecake in the preheated oven for 1 hour to 1 hour 10 minutes, or until the edges are set and the center is slightly wobbly.</li>
        <li>Turn off the oven and leave the cheesecake inside with the oven door slightly ajar for about 1 hour to cool gradually. This helps prevent cracking.</li>
        <li>Remove the cheesecake from the oven and let it cool completely at room temperature. Then, cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or preferably overnight to chill and set completely.</li>
        <li>When ready to serve, carefully run a knife around the edges of the pan to loosen the cheesecake, then release the springform sides. Slice the cheesecake into wedges and serve chilled.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><em>Optional: You can top the cheesecake with fruit compote, fresh berries, whipped cream, or chocolate ganache before serving for added flavor and decoration.</em></p>
