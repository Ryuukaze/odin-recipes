    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups strawberries, hulled and sliced</li>
        <li>1 cup blueberries</li>
        <li>1 cup green grapes, halved</li>
        <li>1 cup pineapple chunks, fresh or canned</li>
        <li>2 bananas, sliced</li>
        <li>1 apple, diced </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon honey (optional, for sweetness)</li>
        <li>Juice of 1 lemon (about 2-3 tablespoons)</li>
        <li>Fresh mint leaves for garnish (optional)</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash all the fruits thoroughly under cold water. Prepare them as neededâ€”slice the strawberries, halve the grapes, chop the apple, and slice the bananas.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine all the prepared fruits: strawberries, blueberries, green grapes, pineapple chunks, bananas, and diced apple.</li>
        <li>Squeeze the juice of one lemon over the fruit. The lemon juice not only adds a refreshing citrus flavor but also helps prevent the fruits from browning.</li>
        <li>If desired, drizzle a tablespoon of honey over the fruit for added sweetness. This step is optional and depends on your preference and the sweetness of the fruits.</li>
        <li>Gently toss the fruits together until they are evenly coated with lemon juice and honey, if using.</li>
        <li>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or transfer the fruit salad to a serving dish. Refrigerate the fruit salad for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld and the fruits to chill.</li>
        <li>Just before serving, give the fruit salad a final toss to redistribute any juices. Garnish with fresh mint leaves for a pop of color and extra freshness if desired.</li>
        <li>Serve the chilled fruit salad as a refreshing and healthy dessert or side dish. Enjoy the vibrant flavors and colorful assortment of seasonal fruits!</li>

    </ol>
